To get this working on Android, you'll need to do two things:

1. Modify the "dx" tool for the target platform to support 1024M of memory. You'll see where.

2. After running "ant release" to build the .apk, sign it using this command:

  jarsigner -keystore ruboto-key.keystore bin/IRB-unsigned.apk ruboto

The keyphrase is simply "ruboto"

3. Install it on the phone or emulator like this:

  ANDROID_HOME/tools/adb -s emulator-5554 install -r bin/IRB-unsigned.apk

Replace "emulator-5554" with the name of your target device.

That's it! Have fun!
