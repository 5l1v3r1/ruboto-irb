# Ruboto--Ruby on Android

By the end of the summer, we hope to release a solution allowing you to write full Android apps in Ruby more easily than you currently can in Java. 

Currently, we have an IRB app that also allows for scripts that interface with the Android API. Check it out [on GitHub](http://github.com/ruboto/ruboto-irb/). 

To keep up with our progress or ask questions, join [the mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/ruboto)
