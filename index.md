# Ruboto--Ruby on Android

Currently, we have 2 offerings:

* an IRB app that also allows for scripts that interface with the Android API. Check it out [on GitHub](http://github.com/ruboto/ruboto-irb/)
* a framework for writing full apps in Ruby, also housed [on GitHub](http://github.com/ruboto/ruboto-core/)

To keep up with our progress or ask questions, join [the mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/ruboto) or hop into #ruboto on Freenode.
